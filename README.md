## Countly Python SDK for IoT devices

Countly can be used to store sensor data coming from IoT devices. This repository holds all Python SDKs that can be used by different IoT devices. SDKs also have persistency feature - e.g if data cannot be sent to Countly server, it is saved to be sent later. 

Currently supported devices: 

* Raspberry Pi family of devices (also supporting [Grove sensors](http://www.dexterindustries.com/GrovePi/supported-sensors/)) 
* Intel Edison boards
* Arduino Yun with Grove 

If you are very new to Python, or if you are more comfortable using C++, we also have [Countly C++ SDK repository](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-iot-c++/) for several supported IoT devices.
